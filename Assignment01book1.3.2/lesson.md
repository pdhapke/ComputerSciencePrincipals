## PLTW CSP section 1.3.2 (#7-18)

You will make several functions through the course of the problems and will turn these in through a repl.it homework submission. The functions can be tested before they are submitted by using the console and they will be automatically checked by the assignment as you submit.

You should have the following functions:
1.)  add_tip(total, percent)
2.)  hyp(leg1, leg2)
3.) mean(a, b, c)
4.) perimeter(base, height)
